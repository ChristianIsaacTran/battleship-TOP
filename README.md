# Advice to myself

This is the last project in the advanced javascript portion and this is right after learning about
TDD (test driven development). I need to put what I just learned to use in this assignment, so try to
take it one step at a time with this process. Like it says on the project page:

1. Write a test
2. make it pass

## Battleship project from The Odin Project

This is a projet that combines the javascript logic of battleship with HTML dom elements. We are re-creating a classic game of battleship but with HTML, CSS, and javascript.
