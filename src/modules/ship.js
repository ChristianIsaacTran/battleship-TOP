/*
 the function factory ship() should produce a ship object with the following properties:
 1. ship length 
 2. number of times the ship has been hit 
 3. sunk status (whether it has been sunk or not)

 The odin project also has a reminder that the we are only testing PUBLIC interfaces, so methods or properties that 
 are used outside of the ship object need to be tested. 

 remember to write a test first, then make it pass to encourage TDD and clean code.
